## Privacy Policy

Last updated: May 29, 2017

Your privacy is very important. This privacy policy informs you about what data is collected and how it is used when you run Three of a Kind on your device. 

## What information we collect: 

If any app crashes occur, we collect non-personal device information provided automatically by your device to help understand what caused the crash. 

Also some third party services such as Google Play will share certain data with us while conducting normal business. This is specified in that company's privacy policy and you will typically be asked for permission when such information is shared.


## Ads: 

Our apps show ads from [Google Admob](https://www.google.com/admob/). This company may collect other information outside of our reach. You should read their privacy policy if you are unsure of what data they collect. We do not work with ad providers who have shown poor handling of personal information in the past. 

Since ads are a vital part of providing Three of a Kind as a free app, we take great care in selecting advertising partners. We do not work with companies delivering ads of a pornographic nature or other inappropriate content. As we do not have direct control of which ads are shown in our apps at any given moment, we encourage you to contact us if you find ads in our apps that violate this policy. 

## How we use and disclose information collected: 

We do not collect, sell, or exchange any personal information whatsoever to any other entity at this time. Terms and conditions are subject to change.
